# Tycho 2.0

## Data Visualisation 

### Data Visualisation of Medical data from U.S. health department.

This project is aiming to analyse massive data that contains the details of 50 diseases that occurred in all states of the U.S during the time 1888 to 2014. The Source of this data is from Project Tycho which works with national and global health institutes and researchers to make data easier to use and free to access for public to do analysis and research.

R provides quick and simple tools that make it easier to transform data into visually insightful pieces like graphs. The data gets easier to read and comprehend from the graphs. The following is a list of the various types of graphs are plotted here using Descriptive statistics and ggplot2.

### Note:- 
The generated graphs and plots provided here are offers an overview of the Overall Analysis. For more detailed insights and access to the complete analytical file, please navigate to the GitHub page by clicking on the blue button located at the top of this page. There, you'll find the comprehensive analysis, including additional visualizations, code, and explanations.

## following few graphs are the representation of visualisation used in this Analysis.

- Tree map
- Here, the Tree map shows how the spread of disease varies in terms of magnitude in relation to one another. The most prevalent diseases are shown in the largest quadrilateral region, whilst the least prevalent diseases are shown in the smallest quadrilateral. Additionally, it provides an explanation for two events cases and deaths in terms of the occurrence ratio.
